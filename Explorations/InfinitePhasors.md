# Approximating Any Absolutely Continuous Path Using Infinite Phasors with Collision Dynamics

This mathematical framework allows us to approximate any 2D continuous path using a dynamic system of phasors. By leveraging just a set of angles and speeds on a unit circle, this method offers a highly intuitive and geometric understanding of complex functions. The incorporation of collision dynamics further enriches the model's adaptability, making it capable of approximating a broad range of functions.

## Assumptions

1. **Infinite Phasors**: A bounded sequence of systems with increasing numbers of phasors exists in \( L^2 \), where bounded means \(\sup_n \| f_n \|_{L^2} < \infty\).

2. **Collision Mechanism**: Collision rules are defined as \( f_1' = \alpha f_1 + \beta f_2 \) and \( f_2' = \gamma f_1 + \delta f_2 \), where \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in \mathbb{R}\).

3. **Near-Identical Phasors**: \( d(\omega_i, \omega_j) \) is a valid metric, satisfying the triangle inequality, symmetry, and identity of indiscernibles.

4. **Function Space**: \( f(t) \in L^2 \cap H^1 \), meaning \( f(t) \) is square-integrable and has a square-integrable derivative.

## Definitions

- **Fourier Transform**: \( F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt \).

- **Convergence in Terms of Phasors**: \( f_n(t) \) is an approximation of \( f(t) \) using phasors and \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} | f_n(t) - f(t) |^2 dt = 0 \).

## Lemmas and Theorems

### Lemma 1: Convergence in \( L^2 \) Norm
For any bounded sequence \( \{f_n\} \subset L^2 \), there exists a subsequence \( \{f_{n_k}\} \) and \( f \in L^2 \) such that \( \| f_{n_k} - f \|_{L^2} \to 0 \).

### Lemma 2: \( L^2 \) Norm Preservation in Collision
For \( f_1, f_2 \in L^2 \), \( \| f_1' + f_2' \|_{L^2} = \| f_1 + f_2 \|_{L^2} \).

### Lemma 3: Definition of Near-Identical Phasors
The function \( d(\omega_i, \omega_j) \) is a valid metric, satisfying triangle inequality, symmetry, and identity of indiscernibles.

### Lemma 4: Function Space
If \( f \in L^2 \) and \( f \in H^1 \), then \( f \) is suitable for the analysis.

### Lemma 5: Mapping to Phasors
There exists a function \( \phi(\omega, t) \) such that for any \( \epsilon > 0 \), \( \| e^{i\omega t} - \phi(\omega, t) \|_{L^2} < \epsilon \).

### Theorem 1: Path Continuity
\( S(t) \) is absolutely continuous almost everywhere if \( S(t) \in L^2 \cap H^1 \), where 'almost everywhere' is defined with respect to Lebesgue measure.

## Proof Steps

### Step 1: \( L^2 \) Norm Preservation in Collision Dynamics
Apply Lemma 2 and use induction to show that an infinite sequence of collisions preserves the \( L^2 \) norm.

### Step 2: Fourier Representation
Given \( f \in L^2 \cap H^1 \), \( f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i\omega t} d\omega \).

### Step 3: Mapping to Phasors
Apply Lemma 5 to map each term \( e^{i\omega t} \) to \( \phi(\omega, t) \).

### Step 4: Near-Identical Phasors as Effective Influence
Apply Lemma 3. Define \( \epsilon \) as a small positive number for which \( A_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{d(\omega_i, \omega_j) < \epsilon} A_i \) is bounded. Prove this bound.

### Step 5: Convergence in \( L^2 \) Norm
Apply Lemma 1, showing that \( \{f_n\} \) strongly converges to \( f \) in \( L^2 \) norm.

### Step 6: Path Continuity
Apply Theorem 1 to prove \( S(t) \) is absolutely continuous almost everywhere, as defined with respect to Lebesgue measure.

## Conclusion
The proof confirms that any absolutely continuous path \( f(t) \) in the complex plane can be approximated using an infinite sequence of phasors, with error bounds of \( \epsilon \), taking into account collision dynamics and \( L^2 \) norm preservation.
