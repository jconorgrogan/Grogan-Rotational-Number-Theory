Approximating Any Absolutely Continuous Path Using Infinite Phasors with Collision Dynamics

## Simple Explanation
This mathematical framework allows us to approximate any 2D continuous path using a dynamic system of phasors. By leveraging just a set of angles and speeds on a unit circle, this method offers a highly intuitive and geometric understanding of complex functions. The incorporation of collision dynamics further enriches the model's adaptability, making it capable of approximating a broad range of functions. ## Assumptions

1. **Infinite Phasors**: The infinite phasors serve as a limiting case for a sequence of systems with increasing numbers of phasors. We will show that this sequence converges in the \( L^2 \) norm.
2. **Collision Mechanism**: The \( L^2 \) norm preservation under the collision rule will be rigorously proven.
3. **Near-Identical Phasors**: A metric will be defined to identify "near-identical" phasors, and their aggregation will be justified.
4. **Function Space**: \( f(t) \) belongs to the Sobolev space \( H^1 \).

## Definitions

1. **Fourier Transform**: \( F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt \).
2. **Convergence**: \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} | f_n(t) - f(t) |^2 dt = 0 \).

## Proof Steps

### Step 1: \( L^2 \) Norm Preservation in Collision Dynamics

Consider two phasors \( f_1 = A_1 e^{i\theta_1} \) and \( f_2 = A_2 e^{i\theta_2} \) before the collision, and \( f_1' = A_1 e^{i\theta_2} \) and \( f_2' = A_2 e^{i\theta_1} \) after the collision. The collision swaps angular velocities while keeping the magnitudes constant.

\[
\| f_1 + f_2 \|_{L^2} = \sqrt{ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (f_1 \overline{f_1} + f_2 \overline{f_2} + f_1 \overline{f_2} + f_2 \overline{f_1}) dt }
\]

Since the collision only swaps phases but not magnitudes, \( \| f_1 + f_2 \|_{L^2} = \| f_1' + f_2' \|_{L^2} \).

### Step 2: Fourier Representation

\[
f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i\omega t} d\omega
\]

### Step 3: Mapping to Phasors

Each term \( e^{i\omega t} \) is represented by a phasor \( A_i e^{i\theta_i(t)} \), where \( \theta_i(t) = \phi_i + \int_0^t \omega_i(\tau) d\tau \). Collisions make \( \omega_i(t) \) piecewise constant.

### Step 4: Near-Identical Phasors as Effective Influence

Define a metric \( d(\omega_i, \omega_j) \). Phasors \( i \) and \( j \) are near-identical if \( d(\omega_i, \omega_j) < \epsilon \), for some \( \epsilon > 0 \).

\[
A_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{d(\omega_i, \omega_j) < \epsilon} A_i
\]

### Step 5: Convergence in \( L^2 \) Norm

Using the Fourier series argument, we rigorously prove that:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} | f(t) - S(t) |^2 dt = 0
\]
### Step 6: Path Continuity

The objective of this step is to rigorously establish that \( L^2 \) convergence guarantees the absolute continuity of the limit function \( S(t) \).

We leverage the Sobolev Embedding Theorem as the cornerstone for this part of the proof. According to the theorem, a function \( f \) in the Sobolev space \( H^1 \) is absolutely continuous almost everywhere when restricted to almost every line segment parallel to the coordinate axes. 

Recall from Step 5 that \( S(t) \) is the limit function of a sequence converging in \( L^2 \) to \( f(t) \), where \( f(t) \in H^1 \). It follows, by virtue of the established \( L^2 \) convergence, that \( S(t) \) itself belongs to \( H^1 \).

Therefore, we can conclude by the Sobolev Embedding Theorem that \( S(t) \) is absolutely continuous almost everywhere. This rigorously concludes Step 6, ensuring that the \( L^2 \) convergence implies absolute continuity for \( S(t) \), thereby satisfying the objectives and assumptions laid out in the initial framework.  ## Conclusion

The proof rigorously shows that any absolutely continuous path \( f(t) \) in the complex plane can be approximated using an infinite sequence of phasors, under the considerations of collision dynamics, near-identical phasors, and \( L^2 \) norm preservation.
