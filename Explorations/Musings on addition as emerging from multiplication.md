This theory presents a geometric perspective on arithmetic operations, specifically focusing on multiplication, division, and addition, within the context of integers and circle divisions. It introduces the concept of integers arising from infinity via circle divisions and translates arithmetic operations into spatial transformations in a 3D space. This framework is further formalized using the mathematical structure of fiber bundles, particularly a twisted product over the circle, allowing for a rigorous interpretation of these operations.

## 
- **Circle Divisions**: A circle can be divided into equidistant nodes, representing integers.
- **Infinity Concept**: By continuously dividing the circle, integers arise, forming a continuum from unity to infinity.
- **Fiber Bundle Structure**: The geometry is encapsulated within a fiber bundle with base space \(\mathbb{S}^1\) (the circle) and fiber \(\mathbb{R}\), with a twisting function that defines the helical structure.

## Multiplication: Twisting to a New Dimension

- **Given**: \( N \) original nodes representing a number, placed on a circle (base layer).
- **Multiplication Process**: Multiply by \( L \), creating \( L \) layers.
  - Each subsequent layer contains the original nodes, rotated by \( \frac{360}{L} \) degrees.
  - The rotation forms a helical pattern, resembling a stairwell, and "twists" the nodes into a new dimension.
  - Mathematically, this corresponds to moving along a path in the total space of the fiber bundle.
- **Result**: A 3D arrangement, with each layer carrying the original nodes in rotated positions.

## Division: Following the Rotations Down the Helix

- **Given**: The 3D arrangement created by multiplication.
- **Division Process**: Divide by selecting \( D \) nodes, one from each of the \( L \) layers.
  - Follow the rotations down the helix, selecting nodes that align vertically.
  - The selected nodes are the same points from the original nodes, only now rotated.
- **Projection**: Project the selected nodes onto the bottom plane, forming \( D \) equidistant points.
  - This projection is defined through a map from the total space to the base space, preserving the equidistant nature of the nodes.
- **Result**: A geometric pattern representing the division operation, capturing the original nodes in their rotated positions.

## Addition: Multi-Step Counting Function

- **Given**: A number \( N \), represented by \( N \) nodes.
- **Addition Process**: To add \( k \), repeat the multiplication and division process \( k \) times, incrementing by 1 in each step.
  - E.g., to calculate \( 3 + 2 \), go from 3 to 4 (one step), then from 4 to 5 (second step).
- **Result**: A multi-step geometric process, representing addition as a sequence of "counting" steps.
  - This can be interpreted as a sequence of paths in the total space of the fiber bundle.
