Definitions and Notations
Let 
�
C be a circle with center at the origin 
(

(0,0) and radius 
�
R.

Let 
�
n be the number of equally spaced nodes on 
�
C.

Let 
�
(

P(x,y) be a point on

Theorem 1:

This has been stated as already proven. I assume this proof relies on the Pythagorean theorem and the geometry of the circle.

n=2,6,∞
Mathematical Formulation
We need to find values of 
�
n for which the distance 
�
D between adjacent nodes fits as an integer multiple across the diameter 
2
�
2R of the circle.

We can express this condition as:

�
⋅
�
=
2
�
k⋅D=2R
where 
�
k is an integer.

Proof
For 
�
=
2
n=2, the nodes are at opposite ends of the diameter, and 
�
=
2
�
D=2R.

For 
�
=
∞
n=∞, 
�
=
0
D=0, and 
�
k can be any integer.

For 
�
=
6
n=6, this likely has roots in the geometry of the hexagon inscribed in a circle. A hexagon can be inscribed such that all its vertices coincide with 6 nodes. The distance between each pair of adjacent nodes will be 
�
D, and six of these will fit perfectly into the perimeter of the hexagon, which is also 
6
�
6R.

Interpretation
In terms of interpretation, the fact that 
�
n can only be 2, 6, or 
∞
∞ for the distance 
�
D to fit as an integer multiple across the diameter highlights a special kind of geometric symmetry. This reflects the circle's inherent properties and its connection to other regular shapes like squares and hexagons, essentially making the circle a "bent square" at this point.
