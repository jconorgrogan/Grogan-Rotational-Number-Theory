1. **Infinite Number Line (1-Dimensional):**
   - **Concept**: Start with a one-dimensional infinite number line that stretches indefinitely in both directions.
   - **Infinity as Radius**: Consider this infinite line as representing the "radius" of a hypothetical circle with an infinite radius.

2. **Division and the Ratio of 1/2 (Conceptual Dimension):**
   - **Division Point**: Select an arbitrary point on the infinite number line to represent the division of the line into two halves. This point symbolizes the concept of "halving" infinity.
   - **1/2 Ratio**: By dividing the infinite line at this point, you conceptually create two infinite halves, embodying the ratio of 1/2.

3. **Angle of 60 Degrees (2-Dimensional):**
   - **Circle with Infinite Radius**: Imagine a circle with an infinite radius, with the infinite number line as its radius.
   - **Angle Corresponding to 1/2**: The ratio of 1/2 corresponds to an angle of 60° in a circle. This can be mathematically derived by considering the cosine function:
     - Let \(\angle AOB = \theta\).
     - Since \(OC\) is perpendicular to \(AB\), \(\triangle OCB\) is a right triangle.
     - Using trigonometry in \(\triangle OCB\), we can express \(\theta\) in terms of \(r\) and \(x\):
       - \(\cos \theta = \frac{r}{x}\) or \(\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{r}{x}\right)\).
     - This leads to \(\theta = 60°\), forming a 60° angle at the center of the circle.

4. **6 Equidistant Nodes (2-Dimensional with Geometric Structure):**
   - **Six 60° Angles**: Since the entire circle measures 360°, six 60° angles will fit perfectly around it.
   - **6 Equidistant Nodes**: Place 6 equidistant nodes around the circle at each 60° interval. These nodes represent the geometric structure arising from the original 1/2 ratio.
   - **Symmetry and Geometry**: This construction exhibits rotational symmetry and the geometric principles of division, proportion, and angle preservation.
