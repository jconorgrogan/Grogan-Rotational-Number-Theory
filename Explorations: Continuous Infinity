Continuous Infinity as a Fundamental Concept:

Continuous infinity can be seen as the ultimate circle, where every point on the boundary is interconnected.
The idea of rotations around this circle might serve as the building block for RNT.

By conceptualizing continuous infinity as the unit circle, you could divide this infinite continuity into portions, mapping them to real numbers and making this "continuous infinity" have meaning via itself.
This unbroken chain of divisions can give rise to the real number line, embedding the entire mathematical universe within this infinite continuity.

Moving to the complex plane, continuous infinity could be represented as rotations around the unit circle.
Every complex number can be seen as a point on this circle, and multiplication as rotation, preserving the continuous and infinite nature.

The exploration of higher dimensions, like quaternions and octonions, within the context of continuous infinity, offers a geometric and spatial understanding of complex mathematical structures.
The continuous nature of infinity provides a basis for understanding the symmetries and asymmetries that appear in these dimensions.

The belief that everything arises from continuous infinity might also imply that all mathematical structures are interconnected.

Mathmatical challenges:

Continuous infinity implies an unbroken, seamless continuum, where distinctions between discrete points become blurred.
This may challenge traditional mathematical structures that rely on clearly defined, separate entities, leading to a breakdown in conventional models.

The idea of continuous infinity introduces an infinite number of degrees of freedom within the mathematical system.
This can lead to complexities and ambiguities in defining specific properties, making some mathematical operations and relations challenging to pin down precisely.
Transition to Higher Dimensions:

In the framework of continuous infinity, moving to higher dimensions like quaternions, octonions, and beyond may lead to a loss of certain symmetries and properties.
The higher you go in dimensions, the more the traditional rules and symmetries may break down, reflecting the infinite complexity of continuous infinity.
Breakdown of Algebraic Structures:

Traditional algebraic structures rely on specific properties like associativity, commutativity, and alternativity.
Continuous infinity, as it transcends these discrete structures, might cause these properties to be lost or altered in higher dimensions.

The geometric representation of continuous infinity can become increasingly complex as you move to higher dimensions.
The intuitive understanding that works well in two dimensions might start to break down, making visualization and manipulation more difficult.

Continuous infinity implies that there are infinite ways to transform and rotate objects within the mathematical space.
These continuous transformations might not adhere to traditional mathematical rules, causing a breakdown in conventional understanding and logic
