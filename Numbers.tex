\section*{Hierarchical Structure of Numbers}

\subsection*{1. Level 0: The Infinite Expanse}
\textbf{Entity}: Infinity ($\infty$) \\
\textbf{Description}: The foundational entity. This is the undivided, raw infinite space. All other entities emerge from divisions of this space.

\subsection*{2. Level 1: Primary Divisions - Natural Numbers}
\textbf{Entities}: $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ \\
\textbf{Description}: Divisions of the infinite expanse. Each natural number $n$ represents $\infty$ divided into $n$ parts. For instance, the number 2 represents two infinite entities with a conceptual division between them.

\subsection*{3. Level 2: Secondary Divisions - Rational Numbers}
\textbf{Entities}: Ratios of natural numbers (excluding whole numbers). \\
\textbf{Description}: Further divisions of the primary divisions. A rational $\frac{a}{b}$ (where $a$ and $b$ are naturals and $a < b$) represents the infinite space corresponding to $a$ being divided by the infinite space corresponding to $b$.

\subsection*{4. Level 3: Tertiary Divisions - Irrational Algebraic Numbers}
\textbf{Entities}: Roots of polynomials with integer coefficients that aren't rational. \\
\textbf{Description}: These numbers emerge when considering algebraic equations involving the primary and secondary divisions. For example, $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational but arises from considering the square root of the primary division representing 2.

\subsection*{5. Level 4: The Continuum - Transcendental Numbers}
\textbf{Entities}: Numbers that aren't roots of any polynomial with integer coefficients. \\
\textbf{Description}: These numbers, like $\pi$ and $e$, can't be derived from basic operations on the primary, secondary, or tertiary divisions. They fill in the gaps, ensuring the number line is continuous. They might be seen as the result of infinitely intricate, non-algebraic processes on $\infty$.

\subsection*{6. Level 5: Complex Numbers}
\textbf{Entities}: Combinations of real numbers (from Levels 1-4) with imaginary units. \\
\textbf{Description}: Introducing a new dimension orthogonal to the real number line. Each complex number $a + bi$ can be visualized as a point in this 2D space. The real part $a$ comes from the hierarchical divisions of $\infty$, while the imaginary part is a multiplication of $b$ with the imaginary unit.

\subsection*{7. Level 6: Quaternions}
\textbf{Entities}: Extensions of complex numbers with three imaginary units. \\
\textbf{Description}: Quaternions introduce further dimensions. Each quaternion can be written as $a + bi + cj + dk$, where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are real numbers derived from the divisions of $\infty$ and $i, j,$ and $k$ are the quaternion units.

\subsection*{8. Level 7: Octonions}
\textbf{Entities}: Further extensions with seven imaginary units. \\
\textbf{Description}: Less commonly used but follow the pattern of increasing dimensions. Each octonion has a part that's a real number and parts that are multiples of the seven imaginary units.
