## Definition

A "rotation-based waveform" \( W(t) \) can be mathematically defined as:

\[
W(t) = A \cos(\theta t + \phi) + B \sin(\theta t + \delta)
\]

Where:

- \( A \) and \( B \) are the amplitudes.
- \( \phi \) and \( \delta \) are the phase angles.
- \( \theta \) is the angle derived from a given ratio \( \frac{x}{r} \), according to \( \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{x}{r}\right) \).
- \( t \) is the independent variable (e.g., time).

## Linearity

Given two waveforms:

\[
W_1(t) = A_1 \cos(\theta_1 t + \phi_1)
\]
\[
W_2(t) = A_2 \cos(\theta_2 t + \phi_2)
\]

Any linear combination:

\[
C(t) = c_1 W_1(t) + c_2 W_2(t)
\]

Will also be a valid waveform, satisfying the linearity criterion.

## Completeness

To prove completeness, we must show that any arbitrary function \( f(t) \) can be approximated as:

\[
f(t) = \sum_{n} a_n W_n(t)
\]

Given that \( \theta \) can represent any angle from 0 to \( \pi \), it's plausible to argue that we can approximate any \( f(t) \) with a sufficient number of \( W(t) \) functions at different \( \theta \) values. However, to be rigorous, one must establish a method to calculate the coefficients \( a_n \) such that the approximation error is minimized.

## Orthogonality

For \( W(t) \) functions to be considered orthogonal, we must show that:

\[
\int W_m(t) W_n(t) dt = 0, \text{ for } m \neq n
\]

Given that \( W(t) \) uses cosine and sine functions, which are orthogonal, it's likely that \( W(t) \) functions will also be orthogonal.
