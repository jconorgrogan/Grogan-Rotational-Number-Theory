Given a number 
�
n, place 
�
n nodes equidistantly on a circle. The position of each node is determined by dividing the circle into 
�
n equal sectors, with the nodes at the vertices of these sectors.

A number 
�
n is prime if and only if none of its nodes overlap with the nodes of any number from 2 up to 
�
−
1
n−1. This geometric representation mirrors the arithmetic definition of primes: a number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Overlapping nodes in this construction are a visual manifestation of divisibility. If any node corresponding to 
�
n coincides with a node of a smaller number 
�
k (where 
2
≤
�
<
�
2≤k<n), then 
�
n is composite.
When visualizing all primes starting from the same point, the angle of the first node (counterclockwise to the node on the 
�
=
0
x=0 line) for a prime 
�
p is 
2
�
�
p
2π
​
 . As 
�
p increases, this angle asymptotically approaches zero, causing the node to move closer to the y-axis.
This geometric representation illuminates the nature of prime numbers in a continuous space and hints at limit-based behaviors akin to the principles of calculus. Specifically, to shift the node an infinitesimal distance away from the y-axis, the number of nodes (or divisions on the circle) would need to approach infinity.
