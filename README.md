# Rotational Number Theory
Theory of Rotational Numbers

In the realm of mathematics, natural numbers are usually visualized on a number line, a one-dimensional construct where every number has a unique position. This proposal introduces a different visualization of numbers in a circular or rotational construct, leading to new interpretations and possible mathematical operations.

Basic Constructs

Each natural number, 'n', is represented as 'n' equidistant nodes positioned on a circle. A full rotation (360 degrees or 2π radians) is completed when traversing through all nodes, linking the concepts of counting and rotation. This gives birth to a new system, the Rotational Number System.

Rotational Identity

In this system, each number has a rotational identity, defined as the set of all positions its nodes can take on a circle during a full rotation. Primes have a unique characteristic in this context: their nodes, when rotated, do not align with their original positions until a complete rotation is done. Composite numbers show alignment before a complete rotation.

Exponential, 
�
e: In the context of the Rotational Number System, the exponential function 
�
�
e 
x
  could be interpreted as a scaling transformation that expands or contracts the rotational circle. The base of the natural logarithm, 
�
e, may be viewed as a particular scale that possesses unique properties.

Imaginary unit, 
�
i: As we've discussed, complex numbers could be represented in the 3D version of the model. Here, 
�
i could be thought of as a rotation operator that switches the plane of rotation from the real (horizontal) plane to the imaginary (vertical) plane.

Pi, 
�
π: In this context, 
�
π could be interpreted as a half-rotation in the chosen plane. Therefore, multiplying 
�
i by 
�
π results in a half-rotation in the imaginary plane.

Unity and Zero,

1 and 
0
0: The "+1 = 0" part of Euler's identity could be seen as a translation operator that shifts the rotational position of a number by one node in the direction that completes the circle, effectively leading us back to the starting point.

Hence, Euler's identity

 in this system could be viewed as a sequence of transformations:

Start with the number 
�
e,
Rotate it 
�
π units in the imaginary plane (using the 
�
�
iπ operator),
And then shift the resulting number by one node (with the "+1" operation).
The result is that we return to the original position (0), in a demonstration of the cyclical nature of the Rotational Number System.

1. Exponential 
�
e: The number 
�
e is the base of natural logarithms and is deeply intertwined with the concept of growth and decay, derivatives, and integrals in calculus. In the context of the Rotational Number System, 
�
e can be seen as a scaling factor. When a number is multiplied by 
�
e, it could correspond to an expansion of the rotation circle. This perspective casts 
�
e as a transformative constant that influences the scale or "size" of rotations.

2. Imaginary Unit 
�
i: In the 3D model of the Rotational Number System, 
�
i could be perceived as an operator that rotates the plane of rotation from the real (horizontal) plane to the imaginary (vertical) plane. In other words, 
�
i introduces a new dimension of rotation. This gives 
�
i a role as a dimension-switching operator.

3. Pi 
�
π: The number 
�
π is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. In the Rotational Number System, 
�
π could be interpreted as a half-rotation operator. When a number is multiplied by 
�
π, it corresponds to a half-rotation in the chosen plane. This perspective emphasizes 
�
π as a rotational constant.

4. Unity 
1
1: The number 
1
1 is the multiplicative identity in the standard number system. In the Rotational Number System, adding 
1
1 could be seen as a shifting operator that advances the rotational position of a number by one node. It acts as a unit step operator in the rotational context.

5. Zero 
0
0: Zero is the additive identity in the standard number system. In the Rotational Number System, the position corresponding to zero could be seen as the origin or the starting point of rotations. When a rotation brings us back to this point, it signifies the completion of a full cycle or loop.
