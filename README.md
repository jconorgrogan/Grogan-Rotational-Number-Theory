# Rotational Number Theory
Theory of Rotational Numbers

In the realm of mathematics, natural numbers are usually visualized on a number line, a one-dimensional construct where every number has a unique position. This proposal introduces a different visualization of numbers in a circular or rotational construct, leading to new interpretations and possible mathematical operations.

Basic Constructs

Each natural number, 'n', is represented as 'n' equidistant nodes positioned on a circle. A full rotation (360 degrees or 2π radians) is completed when traversing through all nodes, linking the concepts of counting and rotation. This gives birth to a new system, the Rotational Number System.

Rotational Identity

In this system, each number has a rotational identity, defined as the set of all positions its nodes can take on a circle during a full rotation. Primes have a unique characteristic in this context: their nodes, when rotated, do not align with their original positions until a complete rotation is done. Composite numbers show alignment before a complete rotation.

Exponential,

e: In the context of the Rotational Number System, the exponential function

e

  could be interpreted as a scaling transformation that expands or contracts the rotational circle. The base of the natural logarithm, 
�
e, may be viewed as a particular scale that possesses unique properties.

Imaginary unit,

i: As we've discussed, complex numbers could be represented in the 3D version of the model. Here, 
�
i could be thought of as a rotation operator that switches the plane of rotation from the real (horizontal) plane to the imaginary (vertical) plane.

Pi,

π: In this context, 
�
π could be interpreted as a half-rotation in the chosen plane. Therefore, multiplying 
�
i by 
�
π results in a half-rotation in the imaginary plane.

0: The "+1 = 0" part of Euler's identity could be seen as a translation operator that shifts the rotational position of a number by one node in the direction that completes the circle, effectively leading us back to the starting point.

Hence, Euler's identity

 in this system could be viewed as a sequence of transformations:

Start with the number

e,
Rotate it

π units in the imaginary plane (using the

iπ operator),
And then shift the resulting number by one node (with the "+1" operation).
The result is that we return to the original position (0), in a demonstration of the cyclical nature of the Rotational Number System.
