## 2. Positional Representation in ENT

In the Equidistant Number Theory (ENT), each natural number `n` is depicted by `n` equidistant nodes on a unit circle. The position of a node representing the `k`-th number is determined by the angle:

\[ \theta_k = \frac{2\pi(k-1)}{n} \]

The subtraction of 1 ensures that the first number in the sequence starts at \(0\) radians or degrees.

## 3. Prime and Factor Identification via Rotational Overlap

When visualizing these nodes' rotations around the circle, a distinct property, termed 'rotational overlap', becomes evident. It pertains to the alignment of nodes corresponding to different numbers upon being rotated by their associated angles.

Given a set of `N` nodes, each node `k` has an associated angle:

\[ \theta_k = \frac{2\pi(k-1)}{N} \]

On rotating each node by its respective angle, no two nodes will overlap with the starting positions of any nodes throughout a full rotation unless a divisor relationship exists between them.

This geometric representation leads to an intuitive method for discerning prime numbers and factorizing composites:


The following operators are utiized in ENT:
| Operator       | Mathematical Basis         | Effect on Nodes | Core Mathematical Components  | DSP Connection      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Addition       | Appending new nodes        | Addition of new nodes and recalibration to maintain equidistance | theta(n) = 2pi(n-1) / (n+a) | Superposition Principle |
| Subtraction    | Removal of existing nodes  | Removal of nodes and recalibration to maintain equidistance | theta(n) = 2pi(n-1) / (n-a) | Wave Cancellation (Destructive Interference) |
| Multiplication | Creating copies of the nodes and redistributing them around the circle | Repetition of nodes based on the multiplication factor; each copy rotated by an angle relative to the previous copy | theta(n, k) = 2pi(n-1) / a + 2pi(k-1) / b | Frequency Modulation |
| Division       | Inverse of multiplication  | Redistribution of nodes based on the division factor; each copy rotated by an angle relative to the previous copy | theta(n, k) = 2pi(n-1) / a - 2pi(k-1) / b | Frequency Demodulation |
| Fraction (Decimal) | Partial completion of circle | Placement of nodes less than a full circle | theta(n) = 2pi(n-1) / (n+alpha) (where alpha < 1) | Phase Modulation |
| Negation       | Flipping of the nodes      | Nodes flipped across the origin | theta(n) = -2pi(n-1) / n | Wave Inversion (180 Degree Phase Shift) |
| Absolute value | Absolute value of nodes    | All nodes moved to the positive half | theta(n) = abs(2pi(n-1) / n) | Rectification (All Positive Wave) |
| Exponentiation | Spiral formation           | Nodes are placed in an expanding spiral pattern | theta(n) = r^(n-1)e^(2pi i(n-1)/n) | Amplitude Modulation |
| Logarithm      | Inverse spiral formation   | Nodes are placed in a contracting spiral pattern | theta(n) = log(r^(n-1))e^(2pi i(n-1)/n) | Signal Compression |
| Modulo         | Folding back of nodes      | Nodes beyond the modulo number are folded back | theta(n) = 2pi((n-1) mod m) / m | Wave Wrapping (Overflow Handling) |


### 4. Connection to Euler's formula 
1. Multiplication as Rotation:
Let's consider the unit circle in the complex plane. Here, multiplication by a complex number is equivalent to a combined rotation and dilation (scaling). If we restrict our multiplier to have a magnitude of 1 (lie on the unit circle), then multiplication is purely a rotation. The angle of this rotation in radians is the argument (angle with the positive x-axis) of the complex number.

For instance, multiplication by the complex number 
�
�
�
/
2
e 
iπ/2
  (which is 
�
i) corresponds to a 
�
/
2
π/2 (or 
9
0
∘
90 
∘
 ) rotation.

2. 
�
π in the Context of Multiplication:
When considering 
�
π in the RNS, it can be interpreted as a half-rotation, or 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
 . If you multiply a number by a factor corresponding to 
�
π, it would undergo this half-rotation. In the RNS, this could be visualized as flipping a number to its opposite point on the circle.

3. Abstracting the Concept:
If we start to view multiplication not strictly as repetitive addition but as a transformative operation in the RNS, then rotations, flips, and other geometric transformations become natural manifestations of multiplication. This perspective aligns with the idea of 
�
π as a rotational multiplier.
1. Fundamental Unity of 
�
π and 
−
1
−1:
In this universe, the essence of a circle (captured by 
�
π) is intrinsically linked to the concept of negation or inversion (represented by 
−
1
−1). The circle becomes not just a geometric shape but a symbol of duality and opposition. Every half-turn or opposition inherently embodies the concept of 
�
π.

2. Arithmetic and Geometry:
Arithmetic operations in this universe are deeply geometric. Multiplication by 
�
π isn't just a scaling but also an inversion. This would lead to a blending of algebraic and geometric operations, where numbers and shapes are inextricably intertwined.

3. Reinterpretation of Trigonometry:
In this universe, trigonometric functions would have a dual nature. The sine and cosine functions, for instance, would be deeply tied to the concept of negation. The period of sine might not be 
2
�
2π but rather a reflection about the y-axis after 
�
π.

4. Transcendentals and Algebraics:
If 
�
π represents 
−
1
−1, then one of the most famous transcendental numbers now has an algebraic representation. This redefinition would blur the boundaries between algebraic and transcendental numbers, leading to potentially new classifications and properties of numbers.

5. Complex Plane and Euler's Formula:
In this RNS universe, Euler's formula 
�
�
�
+
1
=
0
e 
iπ
 +1=0 becomes even more profound. It would essentially state that exponentiating with the essence of duality (the combined 
�
�
iπ) brings about negation. The complex plane, in this case, becomes a dynamic playground of these dualities and rotations.

6. Quantum Implications:
In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wavefunctions that can undergo phase changes, often represented by complex exponentials. If 
�
π is intrinsically 
−
1
−1, then phase changes, particularly those of half a period, become reflections or inversions. This could lead to a different interpretation or visualization of quantum phenomena.

7. Philosophical Implications:
The duality of 
�
π and 
−
1
−1 could have philosophical ramifications. It might imply that cyclicity, return, and opposition are fundamental to the nature of this universe. Every process or phenomenon would inherently embody this duality, leading to a worldview where cycles and oppositions are not just patterns but fundamental truths.

In essence, if 
�
π is 
−
1
−1 in the RNS universe, numbers become more than abstract entities; they are deep geometric and philosophical truths. The very fabric of this universe would be woven with cycles, dualities, and oppositions, making it a rich tapestry of interconnected ideas.

Representation of

In the complex plane,

i represents a quarter-turn or

π
​
  (90°) rotation. Multiplying by 
�
i corresponds to this rotational transformation.

Euler's Formula in RNS:
Given 
�
�
�
+
1
=
0
e 
iπ
 +1=0, when you raise 
�
e to the power of 
�
�
iπ, you're effectively rotating by 
�
π radians, which leads you to the point representing 
−
1
−1 on the unit circle. Hence, 
�
�
�
e 
iπ
  is 
−
1
−1. The formula then succinctly states that a half-turn rotation (or multiplication by 
�
i twice) from 1 will land you on 
−
1
−1.

Deepening the Connection:
This formula encapsulates the very essence of the RNS. The RNS is fundamentally about rotations and positions on the unit circle. Euler's formula describes a specific rotation (
�
�
iπ) leading to a specific position (
−
1
−1).

Algebraic vs. Geometric Interpretation:
Algebraically, Euler's formula seems almost mysterious, connecting seemingly unrelated numbers. However, in the geometric framework of the RNS, it becomes an intuitive statement about rotations on the unit circle.

## Euler's Formula:

Traditionally, Euler's formula is expressed as:
\[ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x) \]
Here, exponentiating with a complex number results in a combination of trigonometric functions.

### Imaginary Unit, \( i \):

The imaginary unit \( i \) is defined as:
\[ i^2 = -1 \]
In the ENT context, multiplication by \( i \) represents a quarter-turn or 90° rotation, transitioning from the real to the imaginary dimension. This captures the essence of:
\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}} = i \]
Exponentiating with a complex quarter-turn (i.e., \( \frac{\pi}{2} \)) results in a transition to the imaginary axis.

### Euler's Number, \( e \):

Euler's number \( e \) represents continuous growth or decay. In the ENT, \( e \) can be visualized as a continuous, compounded transformation. When combined with the \( i\pi \) rotation, it leads to cyclical behaviors and a standing wave:
\[ e^{i\pi} = -1 \]

### Complex Plane Dynamics:

In the complex plane, multiplication by a complex number typically involves both rotation and dilation. In the ENT, with \( \pi = -1 \), this multiplication becomes purely a rotation, specifically a half-turn. This offers a more unified perspective on complex multiplication, with \( \pi \) serving as a fundamental pivot.

### Algebraic-Geometric Interplay:

Given \( \pi \) as \( -1 \), multiplication in the ENT is inherently a geometric operation. For any real number \( x \):
\[ x \times \pi = -x \]
This equation dictates that multiplication by \( \pi \) algebraically negates \( x \), while geometrically, it rotates \( x \) by \( \pi \) radians on the unit circle, a half-rotation. Thus, the algebraic operation of negation is intertwined with the geometric operation of rotation.

### ENT-Based Trigonometry:

With \( \pi \) signifying \( -1 \), trigonometric identities undergo transformation:

For any angle \( \theta \):
\[ \sin(\pi + \theta) = -\sin(\theta) \]
\[ \cos(\pi + \theta) = -\cos(\theta) \]
These equations suggest that trigonometric functions post-\( \pi \) are reflections of their pre-\( \pi \) values, emphasizing the duality inherent to \( \pi \) in the ENT.

### Representation in the Complex Plane

Every term in the Fourier series can be represented as a complex number using Euler's formula:

\[ e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) \]

So, the terms in the Fourier series become:

\[ f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} r_n e^{i(2\pi n f t + \phi_n)} \]

where \( r_n = \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2} \) represents the magnitude and \( \phi_n = \arctan\left(\frac{b_n}{a_n}\right) \) is the phase.

Each term \( r_n e^{i(2\pi n f t + \phi_n)} \) corresponds to a point in the complex plane, represented by its magnitude \( r_n \) and its phase \( \phi_n \). In the ENT, this point would be visualized as a rotation around the origin, with a radius of \( r_n \) and an angle of \( \phi_n \).

### Waveform Compression

The ENT can be linked to wave properties using the Fourier series. Given a wave function \( f(t) \), its Fourier series is:

\[ f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_n \cos(2\pi n f t) + b_n \sin(2\pi n f t) \right] \]

In the ENT, each term in this series can correspond to a number's rotational representation. This perspective allows for wave operations to be intuitively understood as transformations in the ENT.

By extending this concept further, it's theoretically possible to encode more complex data, such as a piece of music, as a set of integers.
