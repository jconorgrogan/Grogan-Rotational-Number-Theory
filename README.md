, is often hailed as one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics, linking five fundamental constants: 
�
e, 
�
i, 
�
π, 
1
1, and 
0
0.

Exponential, 
�
e: In the context of the Rotational Number System, the exponential function 
�
�
e 
x
  could be interpreted as a scaling transformation that expands or contracts the rotational circle. The base of the natural logarithm, 
�
e, may be viewed as a particular scale that possesses unique properties.

Imaginary unit, 
�
i: As we've discussed, complex numbers could be represented in the 3D version of the model. Here, 
�
i could be thought of as a rotation operator that switches the plane of rotation from the real (horizontal) plane to the imaginary (vertical) plane.

Pi, 
�
π: In this context, 
�
π could be interpreted as a half-rotation in the chosen plane. Therefore, multiplying 
�
i by 
�
π results in a half-rotation in the imaginary plane.

Unity and Zero, 
1
1 and 
0
0: The "+1 = 0" part of Euler's identity could be seen as a translation operator that shifts the rotational position of a number by one node in the direction that completes the circle, effectively leading us back to the starting point.

Hence, Euler's identity

 in this system could be viewed as a sequence of transformations:

Start with the number 
�
e,
Rotate it 
�
π units in the imaginary plane (using the 
�
�
iπ operator),
And then shift the resulting number by one node (with the "+1" operation).
The result is that we return to the original position (0), in a demonstration of the cyclical nature of the Rotational Number System.
